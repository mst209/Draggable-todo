## Assignment

JS/React/CSS
If you are a React coder, use React. Otherwise, code in the JS framework of your choice.

Make a frontend-only todo list app.
* It has three vertical lists. Todo, Doing, and Done
* Items are created via a form (they can be stored in browser state, no need to have
a backend)
* Items are draggable from one list to another
* Items can be reordered within a list
* When you drag an item into the Done list, confetti explodes on the screen! Or
something else interesting. You can use a package for this.
* Overall the app has a usable design with a unique color palette. You are free to
make whatever UI and UX decisions you want to make it usable. Don't worry, we
aren't looking for a groundbreaking
